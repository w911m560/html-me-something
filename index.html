   <h1>Birds Spotted | May 16, 2020</h1>
   <main>
      <h2>This is a short log of the birds that I spotted and took pictures of over the weekend. Please ignore the
         spotty image trimming around the birds. There are a couple species that I chose to opt out of this (common
         starling, house finch) simply because the additional time it would take to post process
         those as well.</h2>

            <p>I have a soft spot for cardinals because they are a staple of my grandparent's hometown in South Sioux
               City. You can tell how relaxed they are based on whether or not the feathers on their heads are erect.
               This cardinal seemed pretty relaxed even near other birds.

            <p>I took a picture of this hummingbird perched. It's pretty tricky to get a decent picture of these guys
               mid-flight so I'll be setting up a feeder with some lamps pointing light directly at the feeder, this'll
               hopefully give me enough light to get a snap of one hovering

            <p>Brown thrashers usually chill on the ground so they aren't particually hard to take pictures of.

            <p>At this time of year, American Goldfinch feathers shine a bright yellow. During the winter, this color
               tends to dull out.
